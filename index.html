            <h2>Short Bio</h2>
            <p> My adventure began with a leap from Pretoria to Cape Town, 
                where I initially studied travel and tourism. However, 
                destiny had different plans for me. My passion for food 
                ignited during my time in Cape Town, completely changing my path.

                My culinary journey truly began when I started working in a local
                 restaurant. It was there that I crossed paths with the renowned chef,
                Casper, who took me under his wing. Casper's mentorship kindled a fire 
                within me, and I soon found myself immersed in the world of flavors and
                 techniques. Driven by a hunger for excellence, I relocated to 
                 Port Elizabeth to carve my own culinary path.</p>
                
            <p> Determined and resourceful, I kicked off my journey by trading fresh 
                seafood, gradually saving up for a dream that had taken root in my heart.
                After diligent planning and tireless effort, I realized my dream, the 
                birth of "Oceans 11," my very own diner nestled along the harbor. 
                A year later, it finally happened, and the doors of Oceans 11 swung 
                open, inviting patrons to savor my culinary creations.</p>   
                
            <p> As time flowed, my passion continued to flourish. A decade down the 
                line, not only did Oceans 11 thrive, but I also expanded my dreams 
                into reality with the opening of two more branches. Beyond the kitchen, 
                I find solace in the embrace of nature,fishing in tranquil waters and 
                challenging myself on the golf course. Recently, a new passion has 
                taken hold of me , the world of coding. Much like cooking, coding is 
                an art of crafting, a symphony of logic and creativity that I've grown to adore.</p>
